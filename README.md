# FluidFlowlines
MATLAB function and script to plot flowlines (streamline, pathline, streakline) of a steady/unsteady flow vector field. 

To edit fluid vectors, change u,v,w (velocities in x,y,z) in the plotting_field_lines_main document.
Initial conditions for the measured line/fluid element are found at x0 and y0. 

This code does not currently plot nor take into consideration z-direction fluid motion. 

Contourplot is not currently active; many glitches regarding it that need to be fixed.
